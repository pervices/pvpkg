Per Vices package build process

All packages are built in docker containers for their respective distributions. 
The build system regularly generates three types of docker images:

1. Base image
2. Internal testing image
3. Release testing image

The base image is acted as a base layer to generate all the binaries where internal and release images are just used for testing by fetching the corresponding binaries. 
The base image contains the bare minimum required for the build process, once finished will be pushed to DockerHub. 
The actual dependencies are fetched during package build process and will not be preserved in the base image after the package is built.
Per Vices Dockerfiles are available on GitHub see https://github.com/pervices/pvpkg/tree/master/docker.

By passing parameters based on the what we need, one of the three images will be built. 
An example command is shown below which builds an internal image for the Oracle Linux version 8 based on UHD master branch and the release version of GNU Radio from Per Vices.

docker build --tag YOUR_TAG_HERE --file Dockerfile-oraclelinux --build-arg OS_VER=8 --build-arg UHD_BRANCH=master --build-arg PKG=internal --build-arg GRC=true .

Per Vices UHD and GNU Radio Package generation process

This assumes you have the basic knowledge required to generate a package for the operating system you are interested in. 
All the packages are built in a base image mentioned above.

The build files (all distros) for Per Vices UHD are located in the Per Vices UHD repository here https://github.com/pervices/uhd/tree/master/host/cmake (master)

1. debian-pv contains the build files used to generate Per Vices UHD package in a Debian like distro e.g. Ubuntu.
2. rpm-pv contains the build files use to generate Per Vices UHD package in a Fedora like distro e.g. CentOS/OracleLinux/RHEL.
3. pkg-pv contains the build files use to generate Per Vices UHD package in Arch Linux.

The build files (all distros) for Per Vices GNU Radio are located in the Per Vices GNU Radio repository here https://github.com/pervices/gnuradio/tree/main-pv/cmake (main-pv)

1. debian-pv contains the build files used to generate Per Vices GNU Radio package in a Debian like distro e.g. Ubuntu.
2. rpm-pv contains the build files use to generate Per Vices GNU Radio package in a Fedora like distro e.g. CentOS/OracleLinux/RHEL.
3. pkg-pv contains the build files use to generate Per Vices GNU Radio package in Arch Linux.

You can find all the details including build dependencies in the build files. 

NOTE Not all build dependencies are readily available.
For example on Oracle Linux 8 we built a repository of Per Vices build dependency packages see https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/pervices/tools/packages/ 
You can find the build file for the packages by clicking on the packages shown on that web page: package name → build ID → Chroot Name then it will take you to the build root of the package.
For example on Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 we provided a repository of Per Vices build dependency packages see https://launchpad.net/~pervices/+archive/ubuntu/tools/
You can find the build file for the packages by clicking on the View package details shown on that web page.
